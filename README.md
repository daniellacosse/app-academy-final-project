NB: LIKING AND COMMENTING IS CURRENTLY BROKEN!

TODOS:
===

1. Add Ease of Access and Guest Account (to help guide people through the app remotely)
<br>a. Add a generic avatar!
2. Fix UJS implementation of liking and commenting!
3. SQL Cleanup. Create objects through their associations!
4. Polish up icons and the grid view. Debate whether or not I should use a 'grid view' at all.
5. Drag and drop for image upload (via filepicker.io)
